joining of multiple table is known as joins 


Why/ when we use join ?

-- whenever data to be selected or displayed from multiple tables simultaneously we use it 


Types 
1) cartesian joins/cross joins 
2)inner joins/equi joins 
3 outer joins 
	-left outer joins
	-right outer joins 
	-full outer join 
4) Natural join 
5)self join 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 )cartesian joins/cross joins 
-------------------------------
1.1)in cartesian join each record from table 1 will be merged with all the records of table 2

	Syntax -  
1-	Ansi ( American national standard institute )

	select col_name from 
	tbn1 cross join tnb2;

oracle 
	select col_name from tn1,tn2;


eg = select * from emp cross join dept;

oracle 
	select * from 


----------------------------------------------------------

Inner join 

.1)in returns matched records 
	Syntax -  
1-	Ansi ( American national standard institute )

	select col_name from 
	tbn1 inner join  tnb2
	on <join_condition>;

oracle 
	select col_name 
	from tn1,tn2
	where <join_condition>;
----------------------------
join condition 
---------------
it is a condition where two tables are merged 

	SYNTAX :
		Tn1.Col_name = Tn2.col_name;
	example :
		Emp.Deptno = Dept.Deptno;

Q display ename and there department name where they work ?

	select Ename,Dname
	from Emp,Dept 
	where Emp.Deptno=Dept.Deptno;


Q Display employee name, salary and location of all the employee who are working in the chichago

	select ename,sal,loc 
	from emp,dept
	where emp.Deptno=Dept.Deptno
	and loc ='CHICAGO';

ansi syntax 
	select ename,sal,loc 
	from inner join dept 
	 on emp.Deptno=Dept.Deptno
	 where loc ='CHICAGO';


 watd Dname and job for all the employee 
 Q1). WADTD DNAME AND JOB FOR ALL THE EMPLOYEES WHOS JOB AND DNAME STARTS WITH CHARACTER 'S'
	1)select Dname,job from emp,dept where emp.depno=dept.deptno and dname like 'S%' and job like'S%';

 Q2). WAQTD DNAME AND MGRNO FOR EMPLOYEES REPORTING TO 7839
	select Dname,Mgr from emp,dept where emp.depno=dept.deptno and  mgr=7839

 Q4)WAQTD ENAME AND DNAME OF THE EMPLOYEES WHO ARE GETTING COMM IN DEPT 10 OR 30	
	select Ename,Dname from emp,dept where emp.depno=dept.deptno and deptno=10 or deptno=30 and comm is not null;

 Q5) WAQTD DNAME AND EMPNO FOR ALL THE EMPLOYEES WHO'S EMPNO ARE (7839,7902) AND ARE WORKING IN LOC NEW YORK.
	

Q Display no of employee working in each dept ?
	select count(*) no_of_employees,emp.deptno,Dname 
	from emp,dept
	where emp.deptno=dept.deptno
	group by emp.deptno,Dname,loc;
 


 

	select (*) no_of_employees 
	from emp 
	group by deptno;


Q display name in which at least 4 employee are working

OUter join 
---------------
	LEFT OUTER JOIN 

1) it gives matched record from both the table and unmatched record of left table 

	Syntax : 
	
	Ansi : 

		Select COl_name
		from Tn1 left join Tn2 
		on Tn1.Col_name=Tn2.colname;

	oracle :
		Select COl_name
		from Tn1 Tn2 
		where  Tn1.Col_name=Tn2.colname(+);

Q 1) Display employee name and  their department name even though the employee  who don't work in any dept ; 
	select * from 
	emp,Dept
	where emp.deptno=dept.deptno(+);


select * from Dept,emp where dept.deptno(+)=emp.deptno;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	RIGHT OUTER JOIN 

1) it gives matched record from both the table and unmatched record of right table 

	Syntax : 
	
	Ansi : 

		Select COl_name
		from Tn1 right join Tn2 
		on Tn1.Col_name=Tn2.colname;

	oracle :
		Select COl_name
		from Tn1 Tn2 
		where  Tn1.Col_name(+)=Tn2.colname;

Q 1) WQTD EMPLOYEE NAME AND THEIR DEPT NAME even though the dept where no employye are working
	select ename Dname from 
	emp,Dept
	where emp.deptno=dept.deptno(+);

select ename, Dname from emp,Dept where emp.deptno(+)=dept.deptno;

select ename, Dname from Dept,emp where dept.deptno=emp.deptno(+);

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	FUll OUTER JOIN 

1) it gives matched record from both the table and unmatched record of both left and right table 

	Syntax : 
	
	Ansi : 

		Select COl_name
		from Tn1 full join Tn2 
		on Tn1.Col_name=Tn2.colname;

	oracle :
		Select COl_name
		from Tn1 Tn2 
		where  Tn1.Col_name(+)=Tn2.colname;






select * from Dept,emp where dept.deptno(+)=emp.deptno;
